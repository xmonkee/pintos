Please respect the spirit
and the letter of @uref{http://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic/index.shtml#honesty, ,
UChicago's Academic Honesty policy} by refraining from reading any solutions available online or elsewhere.  Reading the source code for
other operating system kernels, such as Linux or Minix, is allowed,
but do not copy code from them literally.  Please cite the code that
inspired your own in your design documentation.

@macro localcvspolicy{}
Instead, we recommend integrating your team's changes early and often,
using your PhoenixForge SVN repository.
This is less likely to produce surprises, because everyone can see
everyone else's code as it is written, instead of just when it is
finished.  These systems also make it possible to review changes and,
when a change introduces a bug, drop back to working versions of code.
